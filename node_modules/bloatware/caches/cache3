Ode to Fart Bread

Oh humble loaf of pungent grace,
You rise with gas in secret space,
A yeast-born symphony of sighs,
A rumbling gust in baker’s guise.

Your crusty shell belies the storm
Within your doughy belly warm—
A whispered toot that softly creeps
As midnight hunger gently peeps.

Slice by slice, your aroma spreads,
A silent chuckle in our heads—
Yet spite your stink, we cannot flee
Your chewy warmth and carb-filled glee.

So here’s to you, foul fragrant friend,
Whose toot-filled gift we still commend—
For though you clear a crowded room,
You feed our hearts (and noses) soon.
